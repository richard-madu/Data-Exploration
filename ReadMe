# Exploratory Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project repository! In this project, I've conducted an in-depth exploration of a dataset, focusing on importing, cleaning, and analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights. This README provides an overview of the project's goals, data wrangling process, research questions, and key findings.

## Data Wrangling
In the data wrangling phase, I utilized the powerful pandas library to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. The following tasks were performed:

### i. Dropping Irrelevant Columns
Certain columns were identified as irrelevant to the research questions and could potentially introduce noise into the analysis. These columns include homepage, tagline, cast, overview, and production_companies. They were dropped to streamline the dataset.

### ii. Handling Missing Values
To ensure the accuracy of the analysis, rows with missing values were dropped. This step was taken to maintain data integrity and avoid biasing the results.

### iii. Removing Duplicate Data
Duplicate entries were identified and removed to prevent skewing the analysis results. This process aimed to provide a more accurate representation of the dataset.

### iv. Splitting and Exploding Genres
Movies with multiple genres were handled by splitting the genres and then exploding them. This allowed for a more granular analysis of movie genres, facilitating better insights into genre preferences.

## EDA and Research Questions
The exploratory data analysis phase focused on answering four research questions using the cleaned dataset:

### i. What is the Most Popular Genre?
By analyzing the frequency distribution of genres, I determined that the most popular movie genre is adventure, while the least popular is documentary.

### ii. What is the Relationship Between Budget and Revenue?
An analysis of the relationship between movie budgets and revenues revealed a positive correlation across all genres. This finding suggests that higher budget movies tend to generate higher revenues.

### iii. What is the Relationship Between Revenue, Budget, and Genres?
By exploring the interaction between revenue, budget, and genres, I identified trends that shed light on how different genres perform financially. This analysis provided insights into which genres are more likely to generate higher revenues given a certain budget.

### iv. What is the Most Profitable Genre?
Through a detailed analysis of profits, factoring in revenue and budget, I determined that the most profitable movie genre is adventure, whereas the least profitable is foreign.

## Key Findings
After conducting the exploratory data analysis, the following key findings emerged:

1. The most popular movie genre is adventure, while the least popular is documentary.
2. There is a positive relationship between movie revenue and budget, regardless of genre.
3. Adventure is the most profitable genre, while foreign movies tend to be the least profitable.
4. Popularity and profitability are positively correlated, implying that more popular genres often yield higher profits.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of exploratory data analysis in uncovering valuable insights from raw datasets. By following the data wrangling process and addressing specific research questions, we gained a deeper understanding of movie genres, their popularity, profitability, and the relationships between budget and revenue. These findings can guide decision-making in the film industry and serve as a foundation for further analysis.
